# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomics somatic mutations in mouse and human datasets, covering:

- Preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq data
- Clustering and annotation of cell types
- RNA velocity inference to understand cellular dynamics
- Somatic variant calling using SComatic
- Functional annotation and interpretation of variants
